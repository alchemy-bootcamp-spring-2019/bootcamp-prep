## Compare to GUI

Setup side-by-side Terminal and Finder/GUI


### Compare and Contrast!

Where am I?

```sh
> pwd
```

What's in this directory?

```sh
> ls
```

Go into a folder:

```sh
> cd <into-folder>
```

Go back a directory:
```sh
> cd ..
```

Lost? Go Home: 
What is home directory (`~`)?
```sh
> cd ~
```

### Setup for Team Exercise

Using your GUI, create a `projects` directory (folder) in your home directory.

Check that you are home:

```sh
> pwd
```
- or get home:
```sh
> cd ~
```
Make a directory:

```sh
> mkdir projects
```

Check that it is there:

```sh
> ls
```

### Cleaning up

Visually clear out commands:

```sh
> clear
```
